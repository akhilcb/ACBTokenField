  s.description  = <<-DESC
  A swift extension on NSTokenField which makes it highly customizable and removes a lot of boilerplate code from implementation. Major features are: No need to subclass/or change anything in XIB/Storyboard. Added few properties which makes it customizable such as `shouldDisplayClearButton`, `shouldDisplaySearchIcon`, `leftView`, `shouldEnableTokenMenu` etc.. No need to implement delegate methods for simpler use cases. Just set an array of token names list or provide a default list of tokens for all indices. Rest will be handled by `NSTokenField`. Supports `NSTokenFieldDelegate` as well with the customization. Just set `tokenDelegate` and implement the methods as usual. Added support for getting `selectedTokenIndex` so that tokens can be customized based on the index. `tokenIndex` provided in `NSTokenFieldDelegate` method has a bug and hence always returns zero. `selectedTokenIndex` will help in the meantime. Support for adding tokens. Support for resetting tokens. Get `tokenIndex` based on the `representedObject` param in delegate methods.
